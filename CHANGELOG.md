# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-08 - untested

### Added
- First build. Reads every plugin the game loaded and every item each one adds, straight from the
  game's own data, and shows them on a page: pick a plugin to see what it adds, or search across
  every plugin at once.
- Filter by kind - weapons, armour, ammo, books, ingredients, potions, scrolls, soul gems, keys,
  misc, lights and spells.
- Take any number of an item. It arrives through the game's own path, so it is exactly what a
  container would have handed over; a spell is taught instead.
- The `itemexplorer.control` DevBench tool: `op=plugins` lists every loaded file with its item
  count, `op=find:<text>` searches everything, `op=give:<formID>[:<count>]` takes an item.
- The catalogue is read on demand and kept, not built at startup, so it costs nothing until it is
  wanted.
